   Recommendation designs use the open-source Velocity design language. Information about Velocity can be found at [https://velocity.apache.org](https://velocity.apache.org).

   A design can be HTML or non-HTML. By default, HTML designs are wrapped with a <div> tag to allow for click-tracking in a Web environment. Non-HTML designs are for non-Web environments where click-tracking is not possible.

   >The maximum number of entities that can be referenced in a design, either hardcoded or via loops, is 99.
