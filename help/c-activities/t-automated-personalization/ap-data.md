# ![PREMIUM](/help/assets/premium.png) Data collection for the Target personalization algorithms{#data-collection-for-the-target-personalization-algorithms}

Target automatically collects and uses a variety of data to build its personalization algorithms in Automated Personalization (AP) and Auto-Target (AT) activities. When a visitor enters the AP or AT activity, a snapshot of information is passed to a set of "training records" (the visitor data that the personalization algorithms will learn on).

To learn more about the Target personalization algorithms, see [Random Forest Algorithm](../../c-activities/t-automated-personalization/algo-random-forest.md#concept_48F3CDAA16A848D2A84CDCD19DAAE3AA).

The following table shows the data collected by Automated Personalization and Auto-Target by default, without the marketer having to do anything, as well as the naming convention used to indicate these attributes in [Personalization Insights Reports](../../c-reports/c-personalization-insights-reports/personalization-insights-reports.md#concept_A897070E1EDC403EB84CFB7A6ECAD767). You can augment the input data set at any time. To learn more about how to upload additional data, see [Uploading Data for the Target Personalization Algorithms](../../c-activities/t-automated-personalization/uploading-data-for-the-target-personalization-algorithms.md#concept_85EA505B37E54514A1C8AB91553FEED6).
