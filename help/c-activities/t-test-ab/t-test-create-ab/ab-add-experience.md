# Add experience{#add-experience}

The Visual Experience Composer (VEC) provides a visual interface for adding and editing the experiences on your page.

For additional detail about experiences, see [Experiences](../../../c-experiences/experiences.md#concept_A2E10F6AFB3D4AEAB6951EE14688848D). 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Experience]**.

   ![Add Experience option](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/assets/add-experience.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you are targeting an experience to an audience, you must select the audience before you can add an experience. A message appears to remind you to choose your audience.

1. Select the elements you want to change and make the desired changes.

   As you hover the elements on your page, the elements are highlighted. Any highlighted element can be altered using the Experience Composer.

   If you created an mbox on the page using Target Classic (formerly Test&Target), that mbox appears as an element that shows the mbox name, and can be modified like any other element.

   For a list of actions that can be performed on an element on the displayed page to change the experience, see [Visual Experience Composer Options](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/viztarget-options.md).


   >[!NOTE]
   >
    >If you deliver an image from a source other than your main page (such as an image hosted on akamai.net and delivered on dell.com), then that image does not display in the thumbnail of the page shown in the flow diagram.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** when you are finished designing the experience.

## Rename experience

Click the [!UICONTROL Rename Experience] icon on an experience in an A/B Test or Experience Targeting (XT) activity to give the experience a new name.

![Rename experience](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/assets/rename-experience.png)

Note that when you name or rename an experience, the following characters are not allowed: 

| Character | Description |
|--- |--- |
|/|Forward slash|
|?|Question mark|
|#|Number sign|
|:|Colon|
|=|Equals to|
|+|Plus|
|-|Minus|
|@|At sign|

## Redirect to URL

Click the More (three vertical ellipses) icon on an experience in an A/B Test or Experience Targeting (XT) activity, then click [!UICONTROL Redirect to URL].

For more information, see [Redirect to URL](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/redirect-offer.md).

**NOTE**: When you name or rename an experience, the following characters are not allowed: 

| Character | Description |
|--- |--- |
|/|Forward slash|
|?|Question mark|
|#|Number sign|
|:|Colon|

## Duplicate an Experience

You can copy an experience in an A/B Test so you can make minor changes to it without having to re-create the experience from scratch. 

On the **[!UICONTROL Experiences]** page (the first step in the three-step guided workflow), click the three vertical ellipses > **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]**. 

![Duplicate experience option](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/assets/duplicate-experience.png)

## Delete an experience

On the **[!UICONTROL Experiences]** page (the first step in the three-step guided workflow), click the three vertical ellipses > **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]**.
