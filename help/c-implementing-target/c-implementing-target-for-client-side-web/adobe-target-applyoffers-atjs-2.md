## Example applyOffers() call

```
adobe.target.applyOffers({response:{

## Example call of Promise chaining with `getOffers()` and `applyOffers()`, because these functions are Promise based

```
adobe.target.getOffers({...})
.then(response => adobe.target.applyOffers({ response: response }))
.then(() => console.log("Success"))
.catch(error => console.log("Error", error));
```
