>This feature requires that you are an [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] (AEM) customer. See [Requirements](../../c-experiences/c-manage-content/aem-experience-fragments.md#section_AE6F0971E1574B3AA324003599B96E5A), below, for more information.

## Overview {#section_95A91830530F493B81C5C9CDB9B783EA}

Using experience fragments created in AEM in [!DNL Target] activities lets you combine the ease-of-use and power of AEM with powerful Automated Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities in [!DNL Target] to test and personalize experiences at scale.

AEM brings together all of your content and assets in a central location to fuel your personalization strategy. AEM lets you easily create content for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices in one location without writing code. Thereâ€™s no need to create pages for every device. AEM automatically adjusts each experience using your content.

[!DNL Target] lets you deliver personalized experiences at scale based on a combination of rules-based and AI-driven machine learning approaches that incorporate behavioral, contextual, and offline variables. With [!DNL Target] you can easily set up and run [A/B Test](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/test-ab.md) and [Multivariate](/help/c-activities/c-multivariate-testing/multivariate-testing.md) (MVT) activities to determine the best offers, content, and experiences.

Experience fragments represent a huge step forward to link the content/experience creators and managers to the optimization and personalization professionals who are driving business outcomes using [!DNL Target].

## Using Experience Fragments in Target Activities {#section_17CE4BE6B2B74CCEBAE0C68DEB84ABB9}

After performing the preceding tasks, the experience fragment displays on the [!UICONTROL Offers] page in Target.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Target] currently looks for experience fragments to import every ten minutes. The imported experience fragment should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The experience fragment is currently imported into [!DNL Target] as an HTML offer. Note that the experience fragment "master" version remains in AEM. You cannot edit the experience fragment in Target.

You can hover over an experience fragment in the list, then click the View icon ![View icon](assets/icon_info.png) to see additional information about the experience fragment, including its public offer delivery URL, its AEM path, and a deep link to open the experience fragment inside of AEM.

## Considerations {#considerations}

* [!DNL Target] currently looks for experience fragments to import every ten minutes. The imported experience fragment should be available in [!DNL Target] within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.
* The experience fragment is currently imported into [!DNL Target] as an HTML offer. Note that the experience fragment "master" version remains in AEM. You cannot edit the experience fragment in [!DNL Target].
* You can import JSON offers as experience fragments into [!DNL Target]. However, these offers are imported as HTML offers. JSON offers (experience fragments) are currently not fully supported in the [!DNL Target] UI.
