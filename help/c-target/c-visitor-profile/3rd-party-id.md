# Real-time profile syncing for mbox3rdPartyId{#real-time-profile-syncing-for-mbox-rdpartyid}

The mbox3rdPartyId is your company's visitor ID, such as the membership ID for your company's loyalty program.

When a visitor logs in to a company's site, the company typically creates an ID that is tied to the visitor's account, loyalty card, membership number, or other applicable identifiers for that company.

When a visitor accesses a page on which [!DNL Target] is enabled, that visitor is assigned a [!DNL Target] PCID. If the visitor then logs in, and the implementation passes the mbox3rdPartyId to [!DNL Target], [!DNL Target] connects that visitor's mbox3rdPartyId with the [!DNL Target] PCID.

Every three to five minutes, updates are synced with the database. When the visitor logs out, the merged data replaces the previous data associated with the mbox3rdPartyId, creating a more complete record of that visitor's actions. If the same attribute exists in both IDs--for example, the PCID has category=hats and the mbox3rdPartyId has category=skis, or if the visitor saw experience A before logging in, but experience B is stored in the mbox3rdPartyId--the attribute stored in the mbox3rdPartyId overwrites the attribute from the PCID. If the visitor was in one activity or experience before logging in, but a different activity and experience are stored in the mbox3rdPartyId, after logging in that visitor is placed into the mbox3rdPartyId activity and experience.

|  PCID (Not Logged In)  | mbox3rdPartyId (Logged In)  | Merged and Saved to mbox3rdPartyId  |
|---|---|---|
|  category=hats  | category=skis  | category=skis  |
|   | store=94103  | store=94103  |
|  Activity 1, Experience A  | Activity 1, Experience B  | Activity 1, Experience B  |
|  Activity 1  |  | Activity 1  |

When the visitor logs out, the merged profile is maintained.

>[!NOTE]

>[!DNL Adobe Analytics] goals won’t be tracked in cases where the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] ID (MID) changes (for example, the visitor changes devices), even though the [!DNL Target] profile might be merged based on the mbox3rdPartyId and still has activity information. For visitors identified with the same MID (those who access the page with the same device), [!DNL Analytics for Target] (A4T) should work as expected.

## Considerations {#considerations}

If your page contains several mboxes and only some use 3rdPartyID, Target does not have a separate visitor profile/context for each visitor request. The 3rdPartyID context takes priority over the PCID context. It’s enough for one mbox to pass 3rdPartyId for its context to take priority over PCID.

For example, suppose a visitor accesses a page prior to logging in and sees an experience. The global mbox does not use 3rdPartyID. After logging in, the visitor sees one of three experiences with child mboxes, some of which use 3rdPartyID. The visitor visits various pages on the site and then uses the Back button to return to the main page accessed before logging in and sees a different experience. In this scenario, the global mbox did not pass 3rdPartyID, but one or more of the child mboxes did. 3rdPartyID took priority over PCID.
