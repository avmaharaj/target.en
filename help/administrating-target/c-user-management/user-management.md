Information about managing Users in Target Standard and managing enterprise Properties and Permissions in Target Premium.

Properties and Permissions functionality is available as part of the [!DNL Target Premium] solution. They are not available in [!DNL Target Standard] without a [!DNL Target Premium] license.

You can tell whether your organization has a Standard or Premium license by clicking the [!UICONTROL Setup] link at the top of the Target UI.

* **Target Standard Customers:** If you see the [!UICONTROL Users] tab ( [!UICONTROL Setup] > [!UICONTROL Users]), your organization has a Target Standard license. Target Standard customers should follow the instructions in [Users](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md) to add users and assign permissions in the Adobe Admin Console. 
* **Target Premium Customers:** If you see the [!UICONTROL Properties] tab ( [!UICONTROL Setup] > [!UICONTROL Properties]), your organization has a Target Premium license. Target Premium customers should follow the instructions in [Enterprise User Permissions](../../administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/property-channel.md#concept_E396B16FA2024ADBA27BC056138F9838) and [Configure Enterprise Permissions](../../administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/properties-overview.md#concept_22F2855DBF0D4754B9460F5D68749C71) to add users and assign permissions in the Adobe Admin Console.
