Dashboard that displays a quick overview of activities.

**activity**

Enables you to test page designs and target content to specific audiences.

**activity change log**

A record of who changed your activities and when the changes occurred.

**activity collision**

An activity collision occurs when multiple activities are set up to deliver content to the same page. If an activity collision occurs, you may not see the expected content on your page.

**activity URL**

The default URL used for an activity.

**AdBox**

Useful for testing marketing from sites that do not have an mbox, such as affiliates.

**at.js**

The [!DNL at.js] library is a new implementation library for [!DNL Adobe Target] designed for both typical web implementations and single-page applications. The [!DNL at.js] library replaces [!DNL mbox.js] for [!DNL Target] implementations.

**audience**

A group of similar activity entrants who will see a targeted activity.  A group of people with the same characteristics, such as a new visitor, a returning visitor, or returning visitors from the Midwest. The Audience feature allows you to target different content and experiences to specific audiences to optimize your digital marketing by displaying the right messages to the right people at the right time. If a visitor is identified as part of a target audience, Target determines which experience to display, based on criteria defined during activity creation. 

**Auto-Allocate**

Auto Allocate identifies a winner among two or more experiences and automatically reallocates more traffic to the winner to increase conversions while the test continues to run and learn.

**Auto-Target**

Auto-Target uses advanced machine learning to identify multiple high performing marketer-defined experiences, and serves the most tailored experience to each visitor based on their individual customer profile and the behavior of previous visitors with similar profiles, in order to personalize content and drive conversions.

**automated personalization**

Automated Personalization (AP) combines offers or messages, and uses advanced machine learning to match different variations to each visitor based on their individual customer profile, in order to personalize content and drive conversions.

## B {#section_03D02D426DB44F2CA79314F73BB2DD84}

**behavioral ads**

Tests and tracks visits to ads and other offsite content. You can also use behavioral ads to identify the same user on and off your site and deliver a consistent experience throughout their web experience.

## C {#section_2CBF7BABD2B74C8286A2992D8C54C8A6}

**campaign**

Same as "activity"

**capture score**

An engagement metric that calculates an aggregated score based on the value assigned to pages visited on the site, from the point the visitor first sees the activity's first display mbox.

**catalog**

The entire set of products or content that are eligible to be recommended.

**category affinity**

Automatically captures the categories a user visits and calculates the user's affinity for the category so it can be targeted and segmented on. This helps to ensure that content is targeted to visitors who are most likely to act on that information.

**collection**

A subset of products or content that are eligible to be recommended.

**combination**

The content variations created when you test multiple content options in multiple locations in a multivariate test. For example, if you are testing three locations, each with three content options, then there are 27 possible combinations (3x3x3). A visitor to your site will see one combination, also referred to as an experience.

**content**

The text or image comprising a test variation within a location. In a multivariate test, a number of content options within multiple locations are compared. In MVT methodology, the content is sometimes referred to as a *level*.

**conversion mbox**

Logs your test or activity results, such as registrations, orders, or sales. Typically, a conversion mbox displays nothing but merely listens. Common locations for the conversion mbox are a registration completion page, an order thank you page, or a click-through. You might also use a global mbox to calculate conversion metrics.

**criteria**

Rules that determine which products or content to recommend. Criteria can be based on popular trends, a visitor's current and past behaviors, or similar products and content.

If you have trouble opening your page in the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer], try the [!UICONTROL Enhanced Experience Composer].

**Enterprise user permissions**

A means of formal administering enterprise-wide user access to Target.

**landing page activity**

A landing page activity allows you to use targeting to display different landing page content for different visits. Otherwise, the landing page shows the same content for each visit. A landing page activity compares different versions of the page to help you see which version of the landing page produces more successful results. In Target Standard, replaced by *experience targeting*.

**location**

A specific content area on a page, often contained by a single DOM element. In MVT methodology, a location is sometimes referred to as a *factor*. A full-factorial multivariate test compares all possible combinations of offers in your locations.

## M {#section_FA130A5F610F4B5DA7A88CF119B8F422}

**mbox**

"Marketing box," the location on your Web page where content is displayed and visitor behavior is recorded. Some mboxes do not display anything. They might track a visitor's progress through your Web site, or might track whether the visitor completes a specific success metric, such as adding an item to the shopping cart or completing a purchase. One such type of mbox is a *conversion mbox*.

**mbox.js**

Prior to Target 16.3.1, [!DNL Target] required a call to [!DNL mbox.js] to create the global mbox required for [!DNL Adobe Target]to deliver [!DNL Target] activities, track clicks, and track most success metrics. This file contains the libraries needed for all of your activities. You do not need to maintain different activity-specific versions of the file. The [!DNL at.js] library replaces [!DNL mbox.js] for [!DNL Target] implementations.

**mbox parameter**

Passed in the page, not the URL. Parameters are used to pass data from your database and to track sales data or to run Adobe Recommendations. Also known as page parameter.

**multivariate test**

**opt-out link**

Enables visitors to opt-out of all tracking and content delivery.

## P {#section_C4ED86CA8CE74D03A8C6586A205C04B4}

**page count**

An engagement metric that measures the number of pages seen in a visit from the point the visitor first sees the activity's first display mbox.

**priority**

## R {#section_86725D549B6F46A6ADEE424F33595705}

**recipe**

Deprecated term defining the content that displays in a location. See *experience*.

**referring URL parameter**

Passes values to the destination page's mbox as referring URL parameters and values. Use these to target on the visitor's origin, for example.

**role**

A group of users with a specific set of privileges.

**remote offer**

Use remote offers to host content outside of [!DNL Target] that [!DNL Target] references and delivers to users' websites. This content might be in a content management or other system, either for ease-of-use or for security reasons.

**reports**

Reports provide information about the progress and results of your activities that help you make decisions based on your data. Report data can help you decide when to end a test, show you which experience or offer is the winner, and provide insights you need to determine next actions.

## S {#section_9482B06EBB09486784492F838289E54D}

**script profile parameter**

Similar to in-mbox profile parameter, but defined with JavaScript that runs on the Target backend, rather than in the browser.

**segment**

**segment filter**

A report filter used to display reports related to a specific segment.

**single-page application**

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page to provide a more fluid user experience, similar to a desktop application.

**success metrics**

The parameters used to measure the success of an activity. Success metrics include key business measures that enable you to determine the success of a given experience or offer in a Target activity. For example, you can determine if a new offer or adding an item to a shopping cart increases your revenue per visitor. Success metrics can be useful for discovering issues with registration, ordering, or purchase funnels, but also simply with visitor or customer engagement.
